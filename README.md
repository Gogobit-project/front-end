GoGoBid is a blockchain-based domain auction platform. Users can submit domains for curation and auction, place real-time bids, and settle transactions securely via smart contracts. The app includes a homepage (featured auctions), auction gallery (filters & search), auction detail (real-time bidding), user dashboard (bids & collections), and a comprehensive Submit Domain flow.

Sleep2Earn addresses these challenges by:
- **Gamifying sleep improvement** through token rewards.
- **Ensuring data privacy** using zero-knowledge proofs (zkTLS) to verify sleep data without exposing raw metrics.
